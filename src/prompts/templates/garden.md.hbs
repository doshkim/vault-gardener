# Gardener — AI-Powered Vault Maintenance Pipeline

Run the full vault gardener. Three phases execute in sequence:
1. **Seed** — process inbox into journals and semantic folders
2. **Nurture** — repair structure, consolidate knowledge, build links
3. **Tend** — lifecycle management, organization, enrichment

**No information is ever deleted** — only reorganized, enriched, and connected.

## Protected Paths

**NEVER read, modify, or process files in these locations:**
{{#each protected}}
- `{{this}}/`
{{/each}}

## Concurrency Safety

Before modifying any file, check its modification time. If the file was
modified in the last 5 minutes, SKIP it — the user may be actively editing.
Log skipped files with reason "skipped: recently modified".

## Instructions

First, read `.gardener/context.md` to understand vault structure and rules.

Then execute the pipeline:

### Phase 1: Seed
Read `.gardener/prompts/seed.md` and execute all steps.

### Phase 2: Nurture
Read `.gardener/prompts/nurture.md` and execute all steps.

### Phase 3: Tend
Read `.gardener/prompts/tend.md` and execute all steps.

## Output

Combined summary from all three phases:
- **Seed**: Inbox items triaged, journals created, salience tags applied, items routed
- **Nurture**: Structure repaired, beliefs consolidated, playbooks/MOCs generated, links added
- **Tend**: Stale notes reviewed, resources organized, notes enriched
